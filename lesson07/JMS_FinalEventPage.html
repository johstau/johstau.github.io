          <p><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>The sunshine state, a place where everyone either looks like they want to hurt you, or are living the most extravagant life imaginable. For me, I joined my family on one of our annual Florida trips in 2017 with my immediate family, our cousins, and some family friends.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;Bonita Springs, Florida</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;The trip began just like every other. All the families tried getting together on the same flight but unfortunately, at least one person wasn’t able to get accounted for. The families ultimately decide it would just be easier to make the long drive. The vacation normally lasted about a week, but this trip in particular was a week and a half (overstaying our welcome in my opinion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>The House</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;All of us kids had the same reaction when seeing these big houses that our parents rented. Everyone dispersed, trying to find the perfect room for themselves and their friend/cousin. One of my best buddies, Jack, and I, turned on the afterburners to out race everyone around the house. Compared to what we grew up with in central Illinois, it was like we were in a castle. This would be the headquarters for the long week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;Adventures</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;Upon our departure of the house, our first stop would be at the local beach, where, all of us would runaround in excitement for the bright sand. The parents un-winded from the long drive; usually by cracking a couple cold ones and catching some rays in a chair. The rest of us made our presence known in the water and on the sand. Football, spikeball, volleyball, castle building, sand throwing, you name it, we did it. These were the times that were savored the most. Unfortunately, the trip would take a turn for the worst.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;Parasailing Accident&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>Our sixth day would make this trip the most memorable thus far. Just like every year, we all try to get in a parasailing day. Typically, this consisted of waking up early to get breakfast, followed by the dads going down to the dock to get us situated. When the time arrived, everyone gathered into a single boat and took off towards the deep waters. Jack and I were the first up; making sure  we could be the first to touch the sky. Sadly, for myself, this wouldn’t be the most fun parasailing experience. When we were hoisted into the sky, the buckle holding me down was loose. As we made began to make our ascent, we hit a large bump in the water, which, in turn, loosened the buckle just enough that I bounced and hit my head against the metal bar. I nearly fell backwards, but caught myself, only to see a stream of blood running down my face. Thankfully, the drivers pulled in me quick, and wrapped up my head. Nothing detrimental came out of it, aside from nearly giving everyone a heart attack. To wrap up this trip, we made our way back to shore where the lifeguards on standby gave me first aid. The rest of the trip went wonderfully, except for the constant migraines.&nbsp;</p>
